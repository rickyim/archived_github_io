Hello! This is Rickyim's GitHub page.

I am currently working on an optical imaging project, in which I focus on image post-processing. We will hopefully finish a paper on that
by the first week of this August.

Besides that, I am also working on survey the techniques in Non-Light-Of-Sight Imaging. 
It's mainly a computational imaging field which trys to image(or just simply locate) the object that is hidden from the sight using 
a reflect wall. This survey will be finished next week.

Also I found something that is very interesting, and I will survey them in the future,
