<p>I am currently working on an optical imaging project, in which I focus on image post-processing. We will hopefully finish a paper on that
by the first week of this August.</p>

<p>Besides that, I am also working on survey the techniques in Non-Light-Of-Sight Imaging. 
It's mainly a computational imaging field which trys to image(or just simply locate) the object that is hidden from the sight using 
a reflect wall. An on-going <a href="NLOS.html">survey results.</a></p>

<p>
Also I found somethings very interesting, and I will survey them in the future,<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deepmind's recent published papers on explaining neurological phenomenon with descoveries in artificial intelligence(mainly deep 
      neural network).
    <li>Judea Pearl's causal inference.
    <li>Sampling theory, e.g. MCMC etc.</li>
     
  </ul>
  
<p>
   For my rest time, I read funny things on weibo and twitter. I also play tennis.
